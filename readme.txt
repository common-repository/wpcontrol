>Simple, yet powerful. I love that I can easily disable all of the features of WordPress I'm not using in a single plugin. It makes new site setup a breeze!

At WPControl, we found that there are many unused features of WordPress that make it a hassle sometimes or we just don't need. There are tons of plugins already out there that will disable a specific feature. But taking the time and energy to optimize all of them was too much. We made just one plugin that has the features of many so you can have a one stop shop for disabling unused features of WordPress. 

Unlike other methods of disabling features, WPControl allows you to disable many features with just a few clicks (no need to hire a developer).

= Settings Include =

* **Disable Comments** - You can disable comments site wide or on specific post types such as posts, pages, and media.

* **Disable Gutenberg** - Disables the Gutenberg block editor and reverts it the Classic Editor 

* **Disable “Try Gutenberg” Nag** - Removes the annoying admin notice that keeps nagging you to try Gutenberg

* **Disable Shortlinks** - The tag is auto generated by WordPress and is used to create shortlinks. If you are already using pretty permalinks, such as the PrettyLinks plugin. Then there is no need for this unnecessary tag. 

* **Disable RSD Link** - RSD Links are used by blog clients and some 3rd parties that utilize XML-RPC requests. If you edit your site through your browser, then you do not need it. Most of the time, it is just unnecessary code. 

* **Remove XFN Profile Link** - The XFN Profile Link is used to add semantic data to links to be used by browsers to assign relationships between profiles. Basically it tells browsers that the site contains links that use XFN Specification

* **Disable wlwmanifest Link** - The wlwmanifest link is used by Windows Live Writer. If you don't use Windows Live Writer then disable the link as it is unnecessary code. 

* **Disable Links to Previous and Next Post** - If your site is not a blog and is used as a CMS, then this feature will remove the previous and next post links in your WordPress theme.

* **Disable XML-RPC Pingback** - Removes XML-RPC method to prevent abuse of site's pingback while you can use the rest of the XML-RPC Pingback method.

* **Disable Gravatar** - Blocks users WordPress from getting user Gravatar from their email to add privacy for the users or prevent inappropriate avatars.

* **Disable Rest API** - Disables the REST-API to prevent abuse of Rest/JSON API.

* **Hide Login Errors** - An attacker can find the authors login using a similar request as mysite.com/?author=1.

* **Remove HTML comments** - Removes HTML comments in source code to add a layer of defense from attackers trying to find the version of plugins.

* **Remove Meta Generator** - This meta tag allows attackers to see the version of WordPress, it serves no useful purpose.
	
* **Disable Right Click** - You can disable the ability to right click on your site, or just specific things like posts, pages, media, front page, and even have the ability to show an alert to the user that right click is disabled.
	
* **Disable Admin Notices** - You can disable all admin notices that appear in the admin settings page.

* **Disable New User Emails** - Stops WordPress from sending new user notification emails to admin.

* **Disable Search** - Disable the front-end search bar in WordPress.

* **Disable Lazy Loading** - Removes the lazy loading functionality that was added in WordPress 5.3.

* **Hide Admin Toolbar** - Hides the admin toolbar when the admin is on the front-end
	
* **Disable Dashboard Widgets** - Gives you the option to disable whichever default dashboard widgets you want.
